\idx{HTML} (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fundamental language for creating and structuring web pages. It consists of tags that define the structure and content of a document, allowing developers to organize text, images, links, and other media elements. HTML documents are hierarchical, with a tree-like structure where each element is nested within others, forming a Document Object Model (DOM). Developers can manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to dynamically update content and interact with users. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduced new features like semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <footer>) and multimedia support (e.g., <video>, <audio>), enhancing the capabilities for building modern web applications. Understanding HTML is essential for web developers to create accessible, well-structured, and responsive websites.

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a dynamic, lightweight programming language primarily used for client-side web development. Developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in the mid-1990s, JavaScript has evolved into a versatile and essential tool for creating interactive and dynamic web content. Unlike Java, which is primarily used for server-side programming, JavaScript is executed on the client's browser, enabling developers to enhance user experiences with features such as dynamic content updates, form validation, and interactive elements. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create modern, responsive web applications. Its flexibility, simplicity, and widespread adoption have made JavaScript an integral part of web development, powering everything from simple webpage animations to complex single-page applications.

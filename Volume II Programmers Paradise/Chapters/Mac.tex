It boasts a sleek graphical user interface (GUI) atop a Unix-like foundation, offering stability and security. Its software ecosystem encompasses a broad array of third-party applications accessible through the Mac App Store and other channels.

Notable features include seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem, such as iCloud and iOS devices, robust security measures like Gatekeeper and FileVault for app and disk encryption, respectively, and advanced privacy controls.

\begin{fancybox}[Git Resources]{}	
	Various git resources exist for use of or with git (an open source, distributed version-control system).

To turn an existing directory into a git repository you can use the \textbf{git init}\index{init} command,
\begin{lstlisting}
git init   # Makes the current directory a git repository.
\end{lstlisting}

Git contains some basic \textbf{configuration}\index{config} that can be set for all the local repositories.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions.
git config --global user.name "[name]"

# Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions.
git config --global user.email "[email address]"

# Enables helpful colorization of command line output.
git config --global color.ui auto
\end{lstlisting}

Some basic commands used by git include cloning repositories with the \textbf{clone}\index{clone} (a local version of a repository, including all commits and branches) command, checking the \textbf{log}\index{log} of previous changes, and checking the \textbf{status}\index{status} of current files.
\begin{lstlisting}
git clone https://github.com/torodean/Antonius-Handbook-II.git

git log         # Prints a list of the commits and their messages.
git log --stat  # Shows individual file changes along with the log.

git status      # Checks which state current files are in.
\end{lstlisting}

To \textbf{synchronize}\index{fetch}\index{merge}\index{pull} your local repository with the remote repository.
\begin{lstlisting}
git fetch    # Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches.
git merge    # Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch. 
git pull     # A combination of git fetch and git merge.
\end{lstlisting}

To record changes to a git repository, you will primarily use the \textbf{add}\index{add}, \textbf{commit}\index{commit} (a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA), \textbf{diff}\index{diff}, and \textbf{push}\index{push} commands. The \textbf{add}\index{add} command can be thought of to ``add precisely this content to the next commit''. 
\begin{lstlisting}
git add -A             # Stages all files to be committed.
git add textFile.txt   # Stages a text file named 'textFile'.
git rm textFile.txt    # Removes a text file from staging.

git diff               # Shows unstaged changes.
git diff --cached      # Shows staged changes.

git commit             # Commits changes and asks for commit message.
git commit -m "text"   # Commits changes with a string as the commit message.
git commit -v          # includes the diff output into the commit.

git push               # Updates remote references using local references.
\end{lstlisting}




The \textbf{branch}\index{branch} (a lightweight movable pointer to a commit) command is used to create a new branch. The \textbf{checkout}\index{checkout} command is used to change the working branch.
\begin{lstlisting}
git branch                # Lists all branches.
git branch --merged       # See merged to current branches.
git branch -v             # See last commit on each branch.

git branch issue087       # Creates a branch issue087.
git checkout issue087     # Changes to the branch issue087.
git branch -d issue087    # Deletes the branch issue087.

git checkout -b issue087  # Does both of the above commands in one line.
\end{lstlisting}

The \textbf{merge}\index{merge} command is used to combine multiple branches after work on them is finished. To assist with merge conflicts, you can use \textbf{mergetool}\index{mergetool}.
\begin{lstlisting}
git checkout master      # Changes to the master branch.
git merge issue087       # Attempts to merge master and issue087.

git mergetool            # Starts mergetool to assist with merge conflicts.
\end{lstlisting}

Using the fork command, one can create a copy of a repository owned by a different user.
\begin{lstlisting}
git fork [URL]
\end{lstlisting}

Sometimes a file or type of file(s) are desired to be ignored by git and not push to the repository. This cane be done by creating a special file named \textbf{.gitignore}\index{gitignore}.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Example of a .gitignore file. This file tells git to ignore the following types of files.
*.aux
*.log
*.synctex.gz
*.toc
*.o
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Advanced Git}

A useful tool is \textbf{stash}\index{stash} (code must be staged to be stashed), which lets you save code without making a commit \cite{git}\cite{git: Advanced}.
\begin{lstlisting}
git stash        # Makes a temporary local save of your repository.
git stash list   # Show's a list of stashes that have been made.
git stash apply  # Reapplies the content of a stash.
git stash branch # Carry over stashed commits to new branch.
git drop         # Used to remove stashes individually.
git stash clear  # Used to remove all stashes.

git checkout .   # Resets all uncommitted code.
\end{lstlisting}

The \textbf{reset}\index{reset} tool is used for accidental commits or reversing commits \cite{git}\cite{git: Advanced}.
\begin{lstlisting}
git reset                  # Lets you modify your repository before doing a commit.
git reset --soft HEAD~NUM. # Resets the most recent $NUM of commits.
git reset --hard HEAD~NUM  # Erases your last $NUM of commits.
\end{lstlisting}

The \textbf{bisect}\index{bisect} tool will present you with the details of a commit when compared with another. By referencing a good commit and a bad commit, git will traverse between the two and ask you which ones are good and which ones are bad and then you can display the differences after the process is finished \cite{git}\cite{git: Advanced}.
\begin{lstlisting}
git bisect        # Allows you to hunt for bad commits.
git bisect start  # Tells git that there is a bad commit.
git bisect bad    # Tells git which commit is bad.
git bisect good   # Tells git which commit is good.
git show          # Show the commit to indentify the issue.
\end{lstlisting}

The \textbf{rebase}\index{rebase} tool is used to combine commits. The rebase tool can be dangerous as it could potentially permanently delete files. It is recommended to view the documentation before using it \cite{git}\cite{git: Advanced}.
\begin{lstlisting}
git rebase   # Allows for applying changes from one branch onto another.
\end{lstlisting}

To view and change the url that the git repository is using to update, you can use the 
textbf{git remote} command.
\begin{lstlisting}
git remote -v  # Lists the remote url of the repository.
git remote set-url origin <NEW-URL>  # Change the url of the repo.
\end{lstlisting}

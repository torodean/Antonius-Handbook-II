Some basic commands used by git include cloning repositories with the \textbf{clone}\index{clone} command, checking the \textbf{log}\index{log} of previous changes, and checking the \textbf{status}\index{status} of current files.
\begin{lstlisting}
git clone https://github.com/torodean/Antonius-Handbook-II.git

git log         # Prints a list of the commits and their messages.
git log --stat  # Shows individual file changes along with the log.

git status      # Checks which state current files are in.
\end{lstlisting}

To record changes to a git repository, you will primarily use the \textbf{add}\index{add}, \textbf{commit}\index{commit}, \textbf{diff}\index{diff}, and \textbf{push}\index{push} commands. The \textbf{add}\index{add} command can be thought of to ``add precisely this content to the next commit''. 
\begin{lstlisting}
git add -A             # Stages all files to be committed.
git add textFile.txt   # Stages a text file named 'textFile'.
git rm textFile.txt    # Removes a text file from staging.

git diff               # Shows unstaged changes.
git diff --cached      # Shows staged changes.

git commit             # Commits changes and asks for commit message.
git commit -m "text"   # Commits changes with a string as the commit message.
git commit -v          # includes the diff output into the commit.

git push               # Updates remote references using local references.
\end{lstlisting}


The \textbf{branch}\index{branch} command is used to create a new branch. The \textbf{checkout}\index{checkout} command is used to change the working branch.
\begin{lstlisting}
git branch                # Lists all branches.
git branch --merged       # See merged to current branches.
git branch -v             # See last commit on each branch.

git branch issue087       # Creates a branch issue087.
git checkout issue087     # Changes to the branch issue087.
git branch -d issue087    # Deletes the branch issue087.

git checkout -b issue087  # Does both of the above commands in one line.
\end{lstlisting}

The \textbf{merge}\index{merge} command is used to combine multiple branches after work on them is finished. To assist with merge conflicts, you can use \textbf{mergetool}\index{mergetool}.
\begin{lstlisting}
git checkout master      # Changes to the master branch.
git merge issue087       # Attempts to merge master and issue087.

git mergetool            # Starts mergetool to assist with merge conflicts.
\end{lstlisting}

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language renowned for its portability, scalability, and security features. Developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java has since become a cornerstone of enterprise and web application development. One of Java's key strengths is its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, facilitated by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java programs to run on any platform that supports the JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system. Java offers a rich set of libraries and frameworks for building a wide range of applications, from desktop and mobile apps to enterprise systems and web services. Its strong emphasis on object-oriented principles, robust memory management, and extensive community support make Java a popular choice for both beginner and experienced developers alike.









\section{Java Basics}

A basic Java \idx{hello world} program follows. In this program, we define a class named HelloWorld. Inside this class, we have a main method, which is the entry point of the program. Within the main method, we use System.out.println() to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

\begin{lstlisting}
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

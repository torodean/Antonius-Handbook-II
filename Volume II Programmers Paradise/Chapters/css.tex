\idx{CSS} (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the visual presentation of HTML and XML documents. It allows developers to define styles for elements such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing, separating the content from its presentation. CSS works by selecting elements in a document and applying styles to them based on rules defined by the developer. It offers various selectors and properties to target specific elements or groups of elements, enabling fine-grained control over the appearance of a web page. CSS can be applied inline within HTML elements, embedded in the <style> tag in the document head, or linked externally to the HTML file. With CSS, developers can create visually appealing and responsive web designs, improving user experience and accessibility across different devices and screen sizes. Understanding CSS is essential for front-end developers to create attractive and well-designed web interfaces.

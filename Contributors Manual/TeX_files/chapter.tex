\chapter{Introduction}

This document is designed to provide a detailed outline of the correct way to contribute in Antonius' Handbook. This manual will outline the process of setting up git on a machine for tracking project changes, making properly formatted changes, and pushing changes to the git server. For a proper editing environment, Git and a \LaTeX editor are required. By the nature of this project, this tutorial will assume basic computer skills and knowledge.


\section{Installing Git}

Before additions can be made to Antonius' Handbook, you must have a way to obtain the current source code. This is done via Git by downloading and syncing the source code to the most recent copy before editing. All code for this project is open sourced on Github.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Head over to https://git-scm.com/ and download the latest release.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Additions to the Handbook}

Code can be included as so:

\begin{lstlisting}
public static void Life(){
	if(life == "rough"){
		self.getOverit();
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
